1) Right Join
2) Left Join
3) Inner Join
4) Outer Join

--Solution
Joins work on matching keys. Each key is cross joined on each match(one to many) in duplicate keys. 
Inner Join: 
1 - 4*3 + 0-1*1 + Null(0) - not considered = 13

Left Join:
Inner join + Null(=1 instance in A) = 14

Right Join:
Inner join + Null(=2 instance in B) = 15

Outer Join: 
Inner join + Null(=1 instance in A + 2 in B) = 16
